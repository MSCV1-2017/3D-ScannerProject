# 3D-ScannerProject
Software Engineering Project (C++)

## Overview
High quality and affordable 3D scanners have now become very familiar in
many aspects of our everyday lives and are no longer restricted to
industrial or academic applications. It is now well understood that 3D
printing, augmented and virtual reality are much more than promising
technologies and that affordable and meaningful 3D content is urgently
needed.
One way to produce content is 3D scanning of real life objects. More
precisely, 3D scanning of people is one of the most interesting applications.
However, 3D scanning of people is very challenging if you want to achieve
a repeatable level of quality at a certain speed, except for when you have a
3D scanning rig, which combines point-and-shoot functionality with
