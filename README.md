# 3D-ScannerProject
Software Engineering Project (C++)

## Obejectives
To replace the skanect software by our
own, home-made acquisition and processing software so that we no longer
depend on proprietary software. Material resources will also be made
available so that functional prototypes can be constructed by the students.
